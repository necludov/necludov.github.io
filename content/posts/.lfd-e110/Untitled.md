# Exercise 1.10

Here is an experiment that illustrates the difference between a single bin and multiple bins. Run a computer simulation for flipping 1,000 fair coins. Flip each coin independently 10 times. Let's focus on 3 coins as follows: $c\_1$ is the first coin flipped; $c\_{rand}$ is a coin you choose at random; $c\_{min}$ is the coin that had the minimum frequency of heads (pick the earlier one in case of a tie). $\\nu\_1$, $\\nu\_{rand}$ and $\\nu\_{min}$ be the fraction of heads you obtain for the respective three coins.

(a) What is $\\mu$ for the three coins selected?
