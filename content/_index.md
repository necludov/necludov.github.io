# About me
---
I'm a postdoc at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) researching generative modeling, AI applications in natural sciences, MCMC with [Alireza Makhzani](http://alireza.ai). Previously I was a postdoc at the University of Amsterdam with [Max Welling](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8200InoAAAAJ). 



I was born in Sevastopol (Ukraine) and at the age of 13 I started competing in Ukrainian olympiads on math and physics. 
Since then I'm interested in studying and understanding nature in all its forms from abstract fields (math, physics, computer science, which I have been studying my whole life) to the practical fields (history, biology, humanities, which I study from pop-science sources in my free time).
