# About me

---
I'm a postdoc at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) studying generative modeling, AI4Science, Optimal Transport, Differential Geometry of probability spaces, MCMC with [Alireza Makhzani](http://alireza.ai). Previously I was a postdoc at the University of Amsterdam with [Max Welling](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8200InoAAAAJ). 

I was born in Sevastopol, Ukraine, and at the age of 13 I started competing in Ukrainian olympiads on math and physics. Since then I’ve been interested in studying and understanding nature in all its forms from abstract (math, physics, computer science) to practical fields (history, biology, humanities, which I also try to study in my free time).

**Regarding the war**\
I know teachers who organized the Ukrainian Physics Olympiad when I was a kid but now fight for Ukraine with an AR in their hands. Ukraine needs help now more than ever. [Here’s a list of organizations where you can make a donation](https://standforukraine.com/).

**Mentoring**\
Part of my time I devote to mentoring at [Brave Generation](https://bravegeneration.org/). Regardless of your background, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about research or academia.
