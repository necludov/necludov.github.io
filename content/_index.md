# About me

<img src="me.jpg" style="width:250px; height: 250px; border-radius: 15%; float: right; padding-right: 0px ">


I’m an Assistant Professor at the [University of Montreal](https://dms.umontreal.ca/en/) and a Core Academic Member at [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/) developing novel methods in generative modelling, Monte Carlo methods, Optimal Transport, and applying those to solve fundamental problems in natural sciences, e.g. finding eigenstates of the many-body Schrodinger equation, simulating molecular dynamics, predicting the development of biological cells, conformational sampling, and protein folding. Previously, I did two postdocs: at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) with [Alán Aspuru-Guzik](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/basic-content-page/about-alan) and [Alireza Makhzani](http://alireza.ai); at the University of Amsterdam with [Max Welling](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8200InoAAAAJ).

I was born in Sevastopol, Ukraine, and at the age of 13 I started competing in Ukrainian olympiads on math and physics. Since then I’ve been interested in studying and understanding nature in all its forms from abstract (math, physics, computer science) to practical fields (history, biology, humanities, which I also try to study in my free time).

**Regarding the war**\
I know teachers who organized the Ukrainian Physics Olympiad when I was a kid but now fight for Ukraine with an AR in their hands. Ukraine needs help now more than ever. [Here’s a list of organizations where you can make a donation](https://standforukraine.com/).

**Mentoring**\
I used to devote part of my time to mentoring at [Brave Generation](https://bravegeneration.org/). Regardless of your background, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about research or academia.
