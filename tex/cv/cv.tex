\section{BIO \& RESEARCH INTERESTS}
Broadly, my interests are information theory, generative modeling, and data compression. Current compression algorithms are not well suited to handle structured and high-dimensional data, such as images and graphs. I'm interested in building computationally efficient entropy coders that can be used with deep generative models. I have 5 years of industry experience applying machine learning to real-world problems, as well as open-source contributions to large projects such as Dask and NeuralCompression.
