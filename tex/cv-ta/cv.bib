What constitutes as novel is decided through a consensus mechanism together with a similarity function, which is selected according to the content type (e.g. full-motion videos, textual documents). Scalability is guaranteed by forming a validation committee with cryptographic sortition, which use statistical hypothesis testing to decide on the probability of a content being novel or not. The system can trade-off computational with statistical performance by manipulating parameters. We discuss the usage of this design to secure the novelty of full-motion videos and end with a proposal of future lines of research that can extend the systems capabilities.}, publisher={figshare}, author={Severo, Daniel}, year={2019}, month={Nov} }

  abstract  = "ICD coding from electronic clinical records is a manual,
               time-consuming and expensive process. Code assignment is,
               however, an important task for billing purposes and database
               organization. While many works have studied the problem of
               automated ICD coding from free text using machine learning
               techniques, most use records in the English language, especially
               from the MIMIC-III public dataset. This work presents results
               for a dataset with Brazilian Portuguese clinical notes. We
               develop and optimize a Logistic Regression model, a
               Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Gated Recurrent Unit
               Neural Network and a CNN with Attention (CNN-Att) for prediction
               of diagnosis ICD codes. We also report our results for the
               MIMIC-III dataset, which outperform previous work among models
               of the same families, as well as the state of the art. Compared
               to MIMIC-III, the Brazilian Portuguese dataset contains far
               fewer words per document, when only discharge summaries are
               used. We experiment concatenating additional documents available
               in this dataset, achieving a great boost in performance. The
               CNN-Att model achieves the best results on both datasets, with
               micro-averaged F1 score of 0.537 on MIMIC-III and 0.485 on our
               dataset with additional documents.",

  abstract  = "Latent variable models have been successfully applied in
               lossless compression with the bits-back coding algorithm.
               However, bits-back suffers from an increase in the bitrate equal
               to the KL divergence between the approximate posterior and the
               true posterior. In this paper, we show how to remove this gap
               asymptotically by deriving bits-back coding algorithms from
               tighter variational bounds. The key idea is to exploit extended
               space representations of Monte Carlo estimators of the marginal
               likelihood. Naively applied, our schemes would require more
               initial bits than the standard bits-back coder, but we show how
               to drastically reduce this additional cost with couplings in the
               latent space. When parallel architectures can be exploited, our
               coders can achieve better rates than bits-back with little
               additional cost. We demonstrate improved lossless compression
               rates in a variety of settings, including entropy coding for
               lossy compression.",
